# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
The "Customer Behavior Analysis" project delves into the intricacies of the food delivery business, aiming to uncover actionable insights for businesses to thrive in a dynamic market. Beginning with data acquisition from the Call Center Restaurant Orders Dataset, the project encompasses 72,314 rows and 17 columns, laying the groundwork for rigorous data preprocessing. 
Moving into exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project explores delivery times, ordering patterns, and engagement levels. The subsequent application of K-means clustering leads to the identification of customer segments based on engagement, delivery preferences, and time-based behaviors. 
These segments serve as the basis for tailored marketing strategies, addressing customer engagement, ordering behaviors, and time-based preferences. From loyalty rewards to reactivation campaigns, each strategy aligns with the distinctive attributes of its target segment. 
The project's final phase focuses on customer retention through churn prediction, employing the Random Forest model. Iterative steps in feature engineering, model selection, building, and evaluation result in a robust model with a high 94% accuracy. 
This project offers a comprehensive framework for businesses in the food delivery sector. Insights from data analysis, segmentation, and predictive modeling provide a strategic guide for enhancing customer satisfaction, fostering loyalty, and optimizing overall performance in a competitive market.
